        Bitfly is a service which allows you to securely transfer files to (almost) any device with a modern browser.
        It is powered by <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> and establishes a peer-to-peer connection between the sending and receiving devices. Your browser provides modern end-to-end encryption meaning that we (or anyone else) do not get to see the contents or metadata of your files and they are always securely transmitted directly from the sending device to the receiving device. No metadata or file contents are ever transmitted to any of our servers.

      <p class="title" click.delegate="showFaqItem(2)"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i> WebRTC? What?</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        <a href="https://webrtc.org/" target="_blank">WebRTC</a> is the technology powering Bitfly and is a relatively recent addition to your browser's toolkit. It is mostly intended for video and audio conferencing but works fine for any type of data. All WebRTC communication is encrypted using
        the latest cryptography algoritms in your browser and is as secure as any HTTPS website you are likely to visit (like Facebook or your bank's website).

      <p class="title" click.delegate="showFaqItem(3)"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i> How do the secret URLs work?</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        Every time you select a file for transfer the Bitfly client will create a unique, single-use 128-bit key and append it to your URL.
        Half of this key is generated by our servers which need it for the WebRTC handshake which creates the peer-to-peer connection between the sending and receiving devices. The other half is generated on the client-side and never leaves your browser. The receiving device needs both parts of the key in order for the transfer to work which makes it hard for us (or anyone else) to spoof the receving device and get unauthorized access to your data. All of this does not mean that Bitfly is 100% secure, please see the next question for a follow-up on the pitfalls of this model.

      <p class="title" click.delegate="showFaqItem(4)"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i> So is Bitfly really secure?</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        The way Bitfly works is relatively secure against simple threats. It is highly unlikely that a third-party would be able to access any data you sent via Bitfly. It is not absolutely secure though! Due to the way the WebRTC handshake works it may be possible for us to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and gain access to your data (we promise we're not doing this!). In this sense Bitfly provides little extra security compared to server based solutions like Dropbox or Google Drive. On the other hand, the ephemeral existence of the files on the network does provide some guarantees that server based solutions do not e.g. somebody successfully gaining unauthorized access to our servers does not allow him or her to view the contents or metadata of any files sent in the past. We monitor our servers for threats and will respond by shutting down the service temporarily in case we detect a malicious actor to prevent compromise of future transfers. With the above in mind, <strong>we advise against using Bitfly for highly sensitive data</strong>.

      <p class="title" click.delegate="showFaqItem(5)"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i> Is sending files via Bitfly anonymous?</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        Bitfly does not provide anonymity like a service like TOR would. While we do not store any logs, our servers do know the IP addresses of both the sending and receiving devices for a short amount of time in order to setup the peer-to-peer connection. While using Bitfly for any kind of illegal material is strictly forbidden we cannot really tell what you are sending (see previous two questions) so it is up to you to be responsible with your data.

      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        Bitfly is open-source and very small (less than 2000 lines of code). You can look at all of our backend and frontend code by clicking on the 'GitHub' button at the bottom of the page. All of the important code is on the client-side and you can inspect it easily with your browser developer tools (the code is also intentionally not minified).

      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        We are not doing any kind of cryptography in Bitfly's code. All of the actual encryption is done by your browser's WebRTC implementation (refer to questions 1 and 2). We do use the crypto-js package to do SHA-1 hashing of the file chunks in order to verify that we have rebuilt your file correctly on the other end, however this has no substantial implication on security.

      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        There are no file-size limits hardcoded into Bitfly. You may get a warning message saying that sending very large files requires plenty of RAM on the receiving device but we have had great success with files up to 4 GiB in size. Right now there is a high probability that a desktop machine will not have enough memory to receive files above 16 GiB without issues.

        <p class="inner-content">
        Bitfly should work for almost anyone with <a href="http://iswebrtcreadyyet.com/" target="_blank">a supported browser</a> but it may fail for some very restricted NAT setups (e.g. behind some corporate firewalls). If you encounter issues please submit a report to one of our GitHub repositories via the GitHub button at the bottom of the page.
