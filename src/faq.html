            <p class="inner-content"> Bitfly is a service which allows you to securely transfer files to (almost) anyone.
            It's powered by <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> and we use it to create a secure peer-to-peer connection between two browsers. By using WebRTC your data does not go through any intermediaries and is automatically encrypted by your browser with modern cryptography.
            This means we (or anyone) do not get to see your files as they do not pass through any servers. Your data goes directly from
            your device to the device you're sending it to.

            <div class="content">
            <p class="inner-content">
            <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> is the technology powering Bitfly and is a relatively recent addition to your browser's toolkit. It's mostly intended for video/ audio conferencing but also works fine for any type of data. All WebRTC communication is encrypted by
            the latest cryptography algoritms in your browser and is as secure as any HTTPS website (from your bank or your goverment).

            <div class="content">
                <p class="inner-content">To a certain degree, yes. We do not store any kind of logs but our servers do remember your IP address for a short duration in order to setup the connection between the sending and receiving devices. While using Bitfly for any kind of illegal material is strictly forbidden, we cannot really tell what you're sending (see previous two questions) so it's up to you to be responsible with your data.

            to the NSA and lying about it?</p>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="inner-content">Bitfly is completely open-source and very small (less than 2000 lines of code). You can look at all of our backend and frontend code by clicking the 'GitHub' button at the bottom of the page. All file-transfer logic is on the client-side and you can inspect it easily with your browser tools. We have intentionally not minified our JavaScript so that you can make sure it's not doing anything malicious or out of the ordinary.

            <div class="content">
                <p class="inner-content">Bitfly should work for almost everyone but it won't work for some very restricted NAT setups (e.g. behind some corporate firewalls) or whenever it fails to setup a peer-to-peer connection between the sending and receiving devices. If you encounter problems please submit an issue to one of our GitHub repos via the GitHub button at the bottom of the page.
