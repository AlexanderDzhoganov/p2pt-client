        Bitfly is a service which allows you to securely transfer files to (almost) any device with a modern browser.
        It is powered by <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> and establishes a peer-to-peer connection between the sending and receiving devices. Your browser provides modern end-to-end encryption meaning that we (or anyone else) do not get to see the contents or metadata of your files and they are always securely transmitted directly from the sending device to the receiving device. No metadata or file contents are ever transmitted to any of our servers.

      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        <a href="https://webrtc.org/" target="_blank">WebRTC</a> is the technology powering Bitfly and is a relatively recent addition to your browser's toolkit. It is mostly intended for video and audio conferencing but works fine for any type of data. All WebRTC communication is encrypted using
        the latest cryptography algoritms in your browser and is as secure as any HTTPS website you are likely to visit (like Facebook or your bank's website).

      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        Secure, absolutely! It is not, however, fully anonymous. While we do not store any logs, our servers do know the IP addresses of both the sending and receiving devices for a short amount of time in order to setup the peer-to-peer connection. While using Bitfly for any kind of illegal material is strictly forbidden we cannot really tell what you are sending (see previous two questions) so it is up to you to be responsible with your data.

        Bitfly is open-source and very small (less than 2000 lines of code). You can look at all of our backend and frontend code by clicking on the 'GitHub' button at the bottom of the page. All of the important code is on the client-side and you can inspect it easily with your browser developer tools (the code is also intentionally not minified). While this setup would be acceptable security-wise for most needs <strong>we advise against using Bitfly for highly sensitive data.</strong> You have been warned.

      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        We are not doing any kind of vital cryptography in Bitfly's code. All of the actual encryption is done by your browser's WebRTC implementation (refer to questions 1 and 2). We do use the crypto-js package to do SHA-1 hashing of the file chunks in order to verify that we have rebuilt your file correctly on the other end, however this has no substantial implication on security.

        <p class="inner-content">
        Bitfly should work for almost anyone with <a href="http://iswebrtcreadyyet.com/" target="_blank">a supported browser</a> but it may fail for some very restricted NAT setups (e.g. behind some corporate firewalls). If you encounter issues please submit a report to one of our GitHub repositories via the GitHub button at the bottom of the page.
