            <p class="inner-content"> Bitfly is a service which allows you to securely transfer files to (almost) any device with a modern browser.
            It's powered by <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> and uses it to establish a secure peer-to-peer connection between two browsers. The browser- provided modern end-to-end encryption means that we (or anyone else) do not get to see the contents or metadata of your files and they're always securely transmitted directly from the sending device to the receiving device.

            <div class="content">
            <p class="inner-content">
            <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> is the technology powering Bitfly and is a relatively recent addition to your browser's toolkit. It's mostly intended for video/ audio conferencing but works fine for any type of data. All WebRTC communication is encrypted by
            the latest cryptography algoritms in your browser and is as secure as any HTTPS website you visit (like your bank's website or PayPal).

            <div class="content">
                <p class="inner-content">Secure, absolutely! Anonymous, kind of. We do not store any kind of logs but our servers do remember your IP address for a short duration in order to setup the connection between the sending and receiving devices. While using Bitfly for any kind of illegal material is strictly forbidden, we cannot really tell what you're sending (see previous two questions) so it's up to you to be responsible with your data.

                <p class="inner-content">Bitfly is completely open-source and very small (less than 2000 lines of code). You can look at all of our backend and frontend code by clicking the 'GitHub' button at the bottom of the page. All file-transfer logic is on the client-side and you can inspect it easily with your browser tools (it's also intentionally not minified). While this setup would be acceptable security-wise for many needs, <strong>we advise against using Bitfly for highly sensitive data.</strong> You've been warned.

            <div class="content">
                <p class="inner-content">We're not doing any kind of important cryptography in Bitfly's code. All encryption is done by your browser's WebRTC implementation (refer to questions 1 and 2). We do use crypto-js to do SHA-1 hashing of the file chunks in order to verify that we have rebuilt your file correctly on the other end but this has no implications on security.

                <p class="inner-content">Bitfly should work for almost everyone with <a href="http://iswebrtcreadyyet.com/" target="_blank">a supported browser</a> but it won't work for some very restricted NAT setups (e.g. behind some corporate firewalls). If you encounter problems please submit an issue to one of our GitHub repos via the GitHub button at the bottom of the page.
