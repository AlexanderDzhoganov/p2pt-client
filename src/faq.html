        <p class="inner-content">
        Bitfly is a service which allows you to securely transfer files to (almost) any device with a modern browser.
        It is powered by <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> and establishes a peer-to-peer connection between the sending and receiving devices. Your browser provides modern end-to-end encryption meaning that we (or anyone else) do not get to see the contents or metadata of your files and they are always securely transmitted directly from the sending device to the receiving device. No metadata or file contents are ever transmitted to any of our servers.

      <p class="title" click.delegate="showFaqItem(2)"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i> WebRTC? What?</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        <a href="https://webrtc.org/" target="_blank">WebRTC</a> is the technology powering Bitfly and is a relatively recent addition to your browser's toolkit. It is mostly intended for video and audio conferencing but works fine for any type of data. All WebRTC communication is encrypted using
        the latest cryptography algoritms in your browser and is as secure as any HTTPS website you are likely to visit (like Facebook or your bank's website).

      <p class="title" click.delegate="showFaqItem(3)"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i> How do the secret URLs work?</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        Every time you select a file for transfer the Bitfly client will create a unique, single-use 128-bit key and append it to your URL.
        Half of this key is generated by our servers which need it for the WebRTC handshake which creates the peer-to-peer connection between the sending and receiving devices. The other half is generated on the client-side and never leaves your browser. The receiving device needs both parts of the key in order for the transfer to work which makes it hard for us (or anyone else) to spoof the receving device and get unauthorized access to your data. All of this does not mean that Bitfly is 100% secure, please see the next question for a follow-up on the pitfalls of this model.

      <p class="title" click.delegate="showFaqItem(4)"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i> So is Bitfly secure or not?</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        <strong>TL;DR - while Bitf.ly is secure against non-sophisticated threats we advise against using the service for highly sensitive data.</strong><br/>

        There are both pros and cons to our approach.<br/>
        - You still have to trust the service (meaning us). There is no viable method for delivery of signed code to the browser. You have to trust that we have not done any malicious modifications to the client-side code and that our servers were not compromised.<br/>
        - WebRTC is potentially vulnerable to man in the middle attacks. Anyone who posseses or could (in theory) guess the information in your secret URL could pretend to be the receving device and get your data. Make sure to keep your secret URLs between you and your recipient. Your data is exposed to anyone who has the full URL!<br/>
        - No data is ever stored on any intermediary server. Your data is gone from the Internet the moment you close the tab. Any compromise of our infrastructure does not expose metadata or contents for any past transfers. We do monitor our servers vigilantly and will shut down the service temporarily in case of compromise. We'll also notify you promptly with a message on the site.

      <p class="title" click.delegate="showFaqItem(5)"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i> Is sending files via Bitfly anonymous?</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        Bitfly does not provide anonymity like a service like TOR would. While we do not store any logs, our servers do know the IP addresses of both the sending and receiving devices for a short amount of time in order to setup the peer-to-peer connection. While using Bitfly for any kind of illegal material is strictly forbidden we cannot really tell what you are sending (see previous two questions) so it is up to you to be responsible with your data.

      <p class="title" click.delegate="showFaqItem(6)"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i> Can I see your code?</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        Bitfly is open-source and very small (less than 2000 lines of code). You can look at all of our backend and frontend code by clicking on the 'GitHub' button at the bottom of the page. All of the important code is on the client-side and you can inspect it easily with your browser developer tools (the code is also intentionally not minified).

      <p class="title" click.delegate="showFaqItem(7)"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i> Is there a file size limit?</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        There are no file-size limits hardcoded into Bitfly. You may get a warning message saying that sending very large files requires plenty of RAM on the receiving device but we have had great success with files up to 4 GiB in size. Right now there is a high probability that a desktop machine will not have enough memory to receive files above 16 GiB without issues.

      <div class="content">
        <p class="inner-content">
        Bitfly should work for almost anyone with <a href="http://iswebrtcreadyyet.com/" target="_blank">a supported browser</a> but it may fail for some very restricted NAT setups (e.g. behind some corporate firewalls). If you encounter issues please submit a report to one of our GitHub repositories via the GitHub button at the bottom of the page.
